# CS-330_Comp_Graphics_and_Visualization

**How do I approach designing software?**

&emsp; Throughout the course I picked up plenty of skills that has helped me understand how to creat a fully realized 3D world. With my knowledge of C++ I was able to understand how most of the coding worked to render designs. I enjoyed to process of following many of my previous work over to the new projects. Which is a tactic I used to move on to tougher projects. 

**How do I approach developing programs?**

&emsp; My new development strategies while working on my 3D scenes was to stay ahead and constantly be saving and rendering my coding every moment I had from changes. I noticed thorughout the milestones that I would constantly make backups of my files. I never had to make backups before but after all of my previous works, I need to change that and be able to be precautious as there can be any big possible changes that can ruin all of the coding. 

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

&emsp; Understanding of computational graphics and visualizations will help me with many future software projects I will have in my courses or in my career path. It expands my knowledge of knowing how graphics are rendered and produced. In the future, I will be working with many software programs and developments that I can use my knowledge and skills that can be applied into making more than a system. In our times, we want to see graphics and designs used in all of our softwares that pop out from other competitors. Understanding how it is done can help me push the limit of graphics and visulizations.
